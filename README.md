# Kirara - A magic tool enables you to communicate with your friends in Telegram everywhere and anytime

## This project is under construction.

## What's kirara?

Kirara is a magic tool that enables you to communicate with your friends in Telegram. Even if without a Telegram account. What you should need is just a Bot Token(You can get it from your friends who has an Telegram account). However, due to the limit of the ability of the Bot users, you can not send messages positively to a user and join a group without an admin grant. We are currently working on that. Once you've deployed kirara, you can use it through a web page to chat with your friends in Telegram.
